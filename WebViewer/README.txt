This package is for 2.0 .NET or higher.

The NeatUpload branding has been removed.

Installation Steps

1. copy the dlls from the /bin into the /bin folder of your web app (or install in the GAC as described in the manual)
2. copy the NeatUpload folder so that  it lands at yourwebapproot/NeatUpload
3. see the Manual.html file for additional information but understand that it is not entirely up to date (this package doe snot support .NET 1.x for example and branding has been removed). 
The main things you need from the manual is how to configure NeatUpload in Web.config

However, the public key is not correct in the current manual.html file so I'm listing it here:


Public key is
